Hello,

Congratulations! You've been selected to join the Djangonaut Program! 🎊 You will be working on the {{ membership.team.project.name }} project.

We are excited by your desire to help contribute back to Django and we want to rocket launch your success! 🚀

We hope you are as excited as we are and can commit to join this program!
Please confirm your acceptance by visiting {{ acceptance_url }} and let us know whether you can be one of our Djangonauts by {{ membership.acceptance_deadline|date:"F d, Y" }} (12:00 UTC).

The Djangonaut Program aims to level up the Django code contributions from our community and to help you become a future leader of Django. 💪 This is an 8 week group mentoring program with an emphasis on sustainability and longevity.

The duration of this program is {{ session.start_date|date:"F d, Y" }} - {{ session.end_date|date:"F d, Y" }}.

If you choose to join this cohort, you will be supported by experienced members of the community working to ensure your success on the program. This includes:

- Captains, community managers who embody Django's supportive culture and will reach out for personal check-ins throughout the program 🤝
- Navigators, experienced open source contributors who will guide you through the process of resolving tickets and facilitating change 👩‍💻

You will also be supported by your fellow Djangonauts who you will be encouraged to work together with when tackling issues. 🫸🫷

As a rough guide, we expect the time commitment of a Djangonaut to be around 4 hours per week. This may be more or less depending on your own constraints and motivation.
