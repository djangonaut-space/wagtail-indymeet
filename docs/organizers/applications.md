# Djangonaut Applications

This document outlines all the steps involved with managing Djangonaut Space applications.

Each session should have its own application. This allows us to best reflect what the applicants want to include.

## Preparation

The general flow is:
1. Copy the most recent application (/django-admin/home/survey/)
2. Update any old references in the questions
3. Remove/Update/Add any questions that are specific to an old session (which projects a person is interested in)
4. Associate the new application with the upcoming session (/django-admin/home/survey/)
5. Set the application as the primary survey for the upcoming session (/django-admin/home/session/)
